### ICML 2024 Paper: Model Editing in T2I Models!

We are excited to announce that our paper, *On Mechanistic Knowledge Localization in Text-to-Image Generative Models*, has been accepted to ICML 2024! You can find the official paper [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/basu24b.html).

We created a dedicated webpage for this work, which you can explore [here](https://t2i-knowledge-localization.github.io/). 

In this study, we explore how knowledge within text-to-image generative models can be localized and precisely altered.
