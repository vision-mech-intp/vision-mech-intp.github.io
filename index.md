This webpage is created by students from the Reliable AI Lab at the University of Maryland, advised by Prof. Soheil Feizi. Contributors include [Keivan Rezaei](https://k1rezaei.github.io/), [Samyadeep Basu](https://samyadeepbasu.github.io/), [Sriram Balasubramanian](https://sriram.live/), and [Arman Zarei](https://armanzarei.github.io/).

We showcase research on the interpretability of text-to-image and multi-modal generative models, with applications in compositionality, reducing spurious correlations, knowledge updating in MLLMs, and editing text-to-image models to prevent specific artistic or copyrighted content generation.
